=================

the symfony rewrite.

a replacement (for the replacement) jailbreaking site for the (seemingly out of date) [jailbrea.kr](http://jailbrea.kr).

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to the code/design/data of the site! Currently, it's fairly basic.

A few guidelines for contributing:

1. **No beta jailbreaks**
2. **No beta iOS versions**
3. **Use one pull request per jailbreak addition** - this will allow us to easily approve/reject new additions on a one-by-one basis.
4. Commit tags for new jailbreaks, in the form of `[jailbreak] <name> <version> for <ios versions>` are recommended :)
5. Try to find the _simplest_ route to jailbreak, such as one click GUIs, that support _as many devices/ios versions as possible_.


## installation
